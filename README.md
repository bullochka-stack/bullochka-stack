### Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ At the moment I am a graduate of the St. Petersburg State Marine Technical University with a degree in Computational Technologies of Ship Mechanics. <br>      Graduated from the university in 2022.<br><br>üå± Python started learning in 2016. <br>      Mainly used for educational projects in which it was necessary to carry out complex calculations. <br>      Over the past 4 years, I have been writing both educational and commercial programs (mostly parsers) in the Python programming language in order to earn additional income. <br>      There was also experience in writing Telegram bots.<br>      In the process of developing parsers, I became interested in web development. I started learning Django on which I wrote a blog. <br>      In the process of studying web development, I got acquainted with relational databases, the MVT pattern in Django, and practiced HTML and CSS.<br>
